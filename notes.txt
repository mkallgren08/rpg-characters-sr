                                ROUTING
=============================================================================
1) Remember that when adding a new route, you have to add the route 
  to two places:
  a) The routedest array in './app/controllers/authcontroller.js'
  b) The list of routes in './app.routes/auth.js', in the form of: 
     ----- app.get('/test', isLoggedIn, authController.test)
     for pages that require logging in or
     ----- app.get('/test', authController.test);
     for pages that don't require logging in. 
2) For post routes, be sure to check the passport.js file under 
  ./app/config/passportfor any authentication methods that need 
  to be called.
